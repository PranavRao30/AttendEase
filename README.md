    In modern educational settings, efficient attendance management is crucial. Traditional methods can be time-consuming and prone to errors. AttendEase leverages BLE technology to automate the attendance process, ensuring that students are marked present only when they're physically in the classroom. With real-time data syncing via Firebase, AttendEase minimizes manual work, offering a seamless experience for both teachers and students.

  The app supports a user-friendly interface, making it easy for educators to manage attendance records and students to monitor their eligibility for exams. Security is paramount, and all data is securely stored and transmitted through Firebase's robust security features.
